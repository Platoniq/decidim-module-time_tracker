        description: Thank you for filling this questionnaire! We are asking you this
          set of questions to help you understand whether your project (and its actions
          carried out on a voluntary basis) is balanced in terms of task distribution
          due to gender. Reflecting on these questions might also be a useful opportunity
          to analyse what are the types of tasks considered important and who usually
          performs these tasks.
        question_1:
          body: How important do you think this task is?
          description: From 1 to 5, do you perceive this task as the most important
            (5), not important at all (1) or something in between?
          option_1: 1 (Not important at all)
          option_2: 2 (Not very important)
          option_3: 3 (Quite important)
          option_4: 4 (Very important)
          option_5: 5 (The most important)
        question_2:
          body: Who do you think usually perform this task?
          description: Do you think this task is mostly performed by people who identify
            with a certain gender?
          option_1: Mostly women
          option_2: Mostly men
          option_3: I don't see differences by gender
          option_4: Other
